            "passage": "In the later part of the nineteenth century, the direction of expansion in the United States shifted from the countryside to the city. During the crises of the 1870s and the 1890s, tens of thousands of families abandoned their farms and ranches and headed for urban areas. Even prosperity produced migration from the countryside to the city. As pioneers settled rural districts, eventually the number of farms or ranches approached the maximum number the land would support. Landowners sought to increase their productivity through mechanization, and those who were successful invested their returns in the purchase of additional land and equipment, expanding their holdings by buying the farms of less fortunate neighbors, who moved on. Compare this pattern of economic development with that of the city, where innovations in manufacturing led to the creation of new opportunities and new jobs. But in the countryside, economic development inevitably meant depopulation. Rural areas in the central part of the country had begun to lose population by the 1880s, and over the next half century most of the rural West was overtaken by this trend. For every industrial worker who became a farmer, 20 young men from farms rushed to the city to compete for his job. Less well-known is the fact that for every 20 young farm men, as many as 25 or 30 young farm women moved from the rural West to the cities. As a government report noted in 1920, young farm women were more likely to leave the farm and move to a western city than were young farm men. This amounted to a stunning reversal of the traditional pattern of western urban settlement, which featured the presence of many young, unattached men among the migrants but almost no single women. What explains the greater rates of female migration to the cities? In the opinion of many contemporaries, young women were pushed out of the countryside by constricted opportunities, particularly limited educational and vocational options.",

Although the details of Earth\u2019s gravitational and magnetic fields give some extra information about what is going on inside Earth, for the most part our understanding of Earth\u2019s interior is still dependent on the detection of seismic waves, the vibrations caused by earthquakes. These waves travel through Earth and are reflected and refracted by boundaries between different layers of rock. What the analysis of seismic waves shows is a layered structure built around a solid inner core, which has a radius of about 1,600 kilometers. This inner core is surrounded by a liquid outer core, which has a thickness of just over 1,800 kilometers. The whole core is very dense, probably rich in iron, and has a temperature of nearly 5,000 degrees Celsius. The circulation of this electrically conducting material in the liquid outer core is clearly responsible for the generation of Earth\u2019s magnetic field, but nobody has ever been able to work out a thoroughly satisfactory model of how this process works. The high temperature in the core is in part a result of the fact that the Earth formed as a ball of molten rock. Once a cool crust had formed around the molten ball of rock, it functioned as an insulating blanket. Even so, without some continuing injection of heat, the interior of Earth could not still be as hot as it is today, more than four billion years later. The extra heat comes from radioactive isotopes (originally manufactured by stars), which decay into stable elements and give out energy as they do so. In about ten billion years, even this source of heat will be used up, and Earth will gradually cool down. ",

Amber is almost always preserved in a sediment that collected at the bottom of an ancient lagoon or river delta at the edge of an ocean or sea. The specific gravity of solid amber is only slightly higher than that of water; although it does not float, it is buoyant and easily carried by water (amber with bubbles is even more buoyant). Thus, amber would be carried downriver with logs from fallen amber-producing trees and cast up as beach drift on the shores or in the shallows of a delta into which the river empties.

Red animal dyes, derived from certain species of scale insects, were also highly valued from ancient times through the Middle Ages.

This accounts for the bluish tinge of what were once bright greens in, for example, woven tapestry. The range of natural colors was hugely expanded and, indeed, superseded by the chemical dyes developed during the eighteen hundreds. By 1900 a complete range of synthetic colors had been evolved, many of them reaching a standard of resistance to fading from exposure to light and to washing that greatly exceeded that of natural dyestuffs.

In constructing the town, Pullman hoped to produce an ideal environment that would help attract workers of a superior type to the railway car industry and retain them.

Frequent trains and trolley cars connected the fairgrounds of the exposition with the town, and on several occasions, George Pullman himself guided the tours. Constructing a fantastic environment for the benefit of tourists, he made sure that any real tensions between his office and the working inhabitants of the town were rendered invisible to the tourist gaze.

In the early nineteenth century, the Chesapeake oyster beds, perhaps the world\u2019s richest trove of the shellfish, were discovered. Following the Civil War in 1865, the exploitation built to the fever pitch of a gold rush. More than 1,000 sail craft, including four-masted schooners, sloops, pungeys, and bugeyes, dragged heavy iron dredges ceaselessly across the \u201crocks,\u201d as the reeflike agglomerations of the shellfish were called, catching oysters by the hundreds of bushels a day. At the height of this activity, the Chesapeake region probably was less isolated than at any time in its history, including present times. In 1886, the oyster harvest peaked in Maryland at some 15 million bushels, an annual production of edible meat equal to the yield from 160,000 head of cattle. The oyster fleet employed a fifth of everyone involved in fishing in the United States. Oyster captains ruled the waves, outgunning attempts to enforce even modest conservation by the Maryland Oyster Navy, charged with policing the oyster beds. On the positive side, the oyster industry of this era used its political clout to force the nearby city of Baltimore to construct the nation\u2019s most modern sewage treatment plant to protect the water quality of the bay. So intense was the oystering that it eventually altered the physical shape of the bay\u2019s bottom, breaking apart the reefs in which oysters naturally grew. Studies comparing old charts of the bay bottom to new bathymetric surveys have found a dramatic flattening of original bottom contours. This made oysters more susceptible to silting over, and perhaps more vulnerable to the diseases that now plague them\u2014though this latter is still speculative. As harvests slid from the unsustainable peaks of the 1880s never to return, people involved in harvesting oysters sought an easy-to-build, cheaper alternative to the big sail dredge craft which would require fewer crew.

Studies comparing old charts of the bay bottom to new bathymetric surveys have found a dramatic flattening of original bottom contours. This made oysters more susceptible to silting over, and perhaps more vulnerable to the diseases that now plague them\u2014though this latter is still speculative. As harvests slid from the unsustainable peaks of the 1880s never to return, people involved in harvesting oysters sought an easy-to-build, cheaper alternative to the big sail dredge craft which would require fewer crew. What evolved was a beamy vessel, usually 38 to 55 feet long, the bottom made with simple crosswise planking. It could be built by a good backyard carpenter, and hundreds were ",

In the case of a film, the viewer would concentrate on its formal qualities (for instance, camera compositions, editing rhythms, settings, lighting effects, dialogue, and sound track) while ignoring the film\u2019s contextual relationships to social and political issues. It is believed that such \u201cnonartistic\u201d considerations only detract from the aesthetic experience the work\u2019s artistic form can provide. Although the formalist approach pares away history, morality, and virtually everything other than color, shape, technique, and composition, this approach does get the viewer to look closely and respond with feeling to the artwork\u2019s sensuous qualities. In contrast to formalism, contextualism is concerned with the appreciation of art \u201cin context,\u201d that is, in relation to the rest of life. Like a wide-angle camera shot, contextualism takes in the big picture. Everything that surrounds and relates to the artwork is relevant: the viewer; the artist; the physical setting of the work; and the art, culture, and society that gave birth to it. For the contextualist, a full appreciation of a f ilm is impossible without information about its director and the director\u2019s creative process, as well as knowledge about the era and the culture of the country in which the f ilm was made. The strong point of the contextualist approach is its ability to expand the viewer\u2019s understanding of the work in relation to the larger world. In contrast to the reductive focus of formalism, contextualism offers the viewer many ways of looking at and giving meaning to the artwork. Its major limitation, the formalists say, stems from its primary concern with facts and theories. They argue that contextualists can often emphasize fact-finding and theorizing to the exclusion of any sensuous response to the work of art. ",
